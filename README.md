This is sort of a scratch pad for my experimentation as I attempt to familiarize myself with the new features added since the C++ '03 spec.

A large part of it is working slowly towards a better working knowledge of working with parameter packs, since variadic templates and functions are probably the two new features most immediately useful to me.
